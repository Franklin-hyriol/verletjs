# Constraints

Particles on their own are not very interesting. Constraints are what bring them to life.

A constraint is a rule that particles must follow. The most common type is the **Distance Constraint**, which forces two particles to remain at a fixed distance from each other. By connecting multiple particles with distance constraints, you can create any shape you can imagine, from simple ropes to complex cloth simulations.

## Creating a Constraint

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="lang">
  <TabItem value="react" label="React">

  In `verlet-react`, you typically don't work with individual constraints directly. Instead, you use higher-level components that manage constraints for you.

  For example, the `<LineSegments>` component creates a chain of particles connected by distance constraints.

  ```jsx
  import { VerletCanvas, LineSegments } from 'verlet-react';
  import { Vec2 } from 'verlet-engine';

  const App = () => {
    return (
      <VerletCanvas>
        {/* This creates 5 points and connects them with 4 distance constraints */}
        <LineSegments
          vertices={[
            new Vec2(100, 100),
            new Vec2(200, 100),
            new Vec2(300, 100),
            new Vec2(400, 100),
            new Vec2(500, 100),
          ]}
        />
      </VerletCanvas>
    );
  };
  ```
  This approach makes it easier to build complex structures without worrying about the underlying constraint system.

  In `verlet-engine`, you can create constraints manually. The most common one is `DistanceConstraint`.

  ```javascript
  import { VerletJS, Particle, DistanceConstraint, Vec2 } from 'verlet-engine';

  const sim = new VerletJS(500, 500);

  const p1 = new Particle(new Vec2(100, 100));
  const p2 = new Particle(new Vec2(200, 100));

  // A constraint that keeps p1 and p2 at 100px distance
  const constraint = new DistanceConstraint(p1, p2, 1, 100);

  const composite = {
    particles: [p1, p2],
    constraints: [constraint],
  };

  sim.composites.push(composite);
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
