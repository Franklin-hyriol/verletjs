# Particles

In a Verlet integration simulation, the world is made of particles (also called points). A particle is the simplest and most fundamental object.

## What is a Particle?

A particle is essentially a point in space that has a few basic properties:
- A **current position** (`pos`)
- An **old position** (`oldpos`)
- An **acceleration** (`acc`)
- A **mass** (`mass`)

You might notice that there is no `velocity` property. This is the key characteristic of Verlet integration. A particle's velocity is implicitly calculated by comparing its current position to its old position. This makes the simulation very stable.

## Creating a Particle

Here is how you can create a single particle in your simulation.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="lang">
  <TabItem value="react" label="React">

  In `verlet-react`, you use the `<Point>` component to create a particle. You just need to provide its initial position.

  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { VerletCanvas, Point } from 'verlet-react';

  const App = () => {
    return (
      <VerletCanvas>
        {/* This creates a particle at position (100, 100) */}
        <Point position={{ x: 100, y: 100 }} />
      </VerletCanvas>
    );
  };
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

  In `verlet-engine`, you create an instance of the `Particle` class.

  ```javascript
  import { VerletJS, Particle, Vec2 } from 'verlet-engine';

  const sim = new VerletJS(500, 500);

  // This creates a particle at position (100, 100)
  // You can also specify mass and other properties if needed
  const particle = new Particle(new Vec2(100, 100));

  // Don't forget to add it to the simulation
  sim.composites.push({ particles: [particle], constraints: [] });
  
  /*

  // The rest of your code to start the simulation
  
  */
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
