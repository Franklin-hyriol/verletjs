# Vec2

The `Vec2` class provides a robust implementation for 2D vectors, which are used throughout the library to represent positions, velocities, and forces.

## Constructor

### `new Vec2([x], [y])`

Creates a new `Vec2` instance.

#### Parameters

- `x` (number, optional): The x-component of the vector. Defaults to `0`.
- `y` (number, optional): The y-component of the vector. Defaults to `0`.

#### Example

```javascript
import { Vec2 } from 'verlet-engine';

const position = new Vec2(100, 200);
const origin = new Vec2(); // (0, 0)
```

## Immutable vs. Mutable Methods

The `Vec2` class offers two types of methods for vector operations:

- **Immutable methods** (e.g., `add`, `sub`, `scale`) do not change the original vector. Instead, they return a **new** `Vec2` instance with the result of the operation. This is useful for preventing unintended side effects.

- **Mutable methods** (e.g., `mutableAdd`, `mutableSub`, `mutableScale`) modify the vector **in-place**. These are more memory-efficient as they don't create new objects, making them ideal for performance-critical code inside the simulation loop.

---

## Common Immutable Methods

### `add(v)`

Returns a new vector `this + v`.

### `sub(v)`

Returns a new vector `this - v`.

### `scale(coef)`

Returns a new vector with each component multiplied by `coef`.

### `normal()`

Returns a new vector with the same direction but a length of 1.

---

## Common Mutable Methods

### `mutableSet(v)`

Sets the components of the vector to match vector `v`.

### `mutableAdd(v)`

Adds vector `v` to the current vector.

### `mutableSub(v)`

Subtracts vector `v` from the current vector.

### `mutableScale(coef)`

Multiplies the components of the current vector by `coef`.

---

## Other Useful Methods

### `length()`

Returns the magnitude (length) of the vector.

### `length2()`

Returns the squared magnitude of the vector. This is faster to compute than `length()` and is useful for comparisons.

### `dist(v)`

Returns the distance between this vector and vector `v`.

### `dot(v)`

Returns the dot product between this vector and vector `v`.
