# Particle

The `Particle` class is the fundamental building block of any simulation. It represents a single point in space with mass.

## Constructor

### `new Particle(pos, [mass])`

Creates a new `Particle` instance.

#### Parameters

- `pos` ([`Vec2`](/docs/api-reference/vec2)): The initial position of the particle.
- `mass` (number, optional): The mass of the particle. Defaults to `1`. A mass of `0` is treated as infinite, making the particle immovable.

#### Example

```javascript
import { Particle, Vec2 } from 'verlet-engine';

const p = new Particle(new Vec2(100, 100));
```

---

## Properties

### `pos`

- **Type:** [`Vec2`](/docs/api-reference/vec2)

The current position vector of the particle. You can modify this property directly to teleport the particle, but for physics-based movement, you should let the simulation handle it.

---

### `lastPos`

- **Type:** [`Vec2`](/docs/api-reference/vec2)

The position vector of the particle in the previous frame. The simulation uses this to calculate the particle's velocity (`velocity = pos - lastPos`).

---

### `acc`

- **Type:** [`Vec2`](/docs/api-reference/vec2)

The acceleration vector of the particle. This is where forces (like gravity) are accumulated before being applied to the particle's position. It is typically reset to `(0, 0)` at the end of each frame.

---

### `mass`

- **Type:** `number`

The mass of the particle. This influences how the particle reacts to forces and constraints. A higher mass means the particle is "heavier" and less affected by lighter particles.

---

### `style`

- **Type:** `ParticleStyle` (optional)

An object used to define the rendering style of the particle. This is not used by `verlet-engine` itself but can be used by your rendering logic or by libraries like `verlet-react`.

```typescript
interface ParticleStyle {
  radius?: number;
  color?: string;
  hidden?: boolean;
}
```
