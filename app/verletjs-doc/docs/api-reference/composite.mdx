# Composites & Objects

This section covers both the low-level `Composite` class and the high-level helper functions and React components used to create common shapes.

## The `Composite` Class

A `Composite` is a container for a group of `Particle` and `Constraint` objects. It is the primary way to group objects in the simulation.

### Properties
- `particles` (Particle[]): An array of particles in the composite.
- `constraints` (Constraint[]): An array of constraints in the composite.

### Methods
- `pin(index, [pos])`: A convenience method to create a `PinConstraint` for a particle within the composite.

---

## High-Level Objects

These are helpers that create and add pre-made composites to the simulation.

### Line Segments

Creates a chain of particles connected by distance constraints.

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="js" label="lineSegments()">

`lineSegments(sim, vertices, stiffness)`
- `sim` (VerletJS): The simulation instance.
- `vertices` (Vec2[]): An array of points for the line.
- `stiffness` (number): The stiffness of the constraints.

<TabItem value="react" label="<LineSegments />">

- `vertices` (Vec2[]): An array of points for the line.
- `stiffness` (number): The stiffness of the constraints.
- `pins` (number[], optional): An array of particle indices to pin.

### Cloth

Creates a 2D grid of particles, ideal for fabric simulations.

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="js" label="cloth()">

`cloth(sim, origin, width, height, segmentsX, segmentsY, pinMod, stiffness)`
- `sim` (VerletJS): The simulation instance.
- `origin` (Vec2): The center point of the cloth.
- `width` / `height` (number): The dimensions of the cloth.
- `segmentsX` / `segmentsY` (number): The number of segments on each axis.
- `pinMod` (number): A modifier for pinning particles on the top edge (e.g., `3` pins every 3rd particle).
- `stiffness` (number): The stiffness of the constraints.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react" label="<Cloth />">

- `origin` (Vec2): The center point of the cloth.
- `width` / `height` (number): The dimensions of the cloth.
- `segmentsX` / `segmentsY` (number): The number of segments on each axis.
- `pinMod` (number): A modifier for pinning particles.
- `stiffness` (number): The stiffness of the constraints.

### Tire

Creates a circular object with spokes.

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="js" label="tire()">

`tire(sim, origin, radius, segments, spokeStiffness, treadStiffness)`
- `sim` (VerletJS): The simulation instance.
- `origin` (Vec2): The center of the tire.
- `radius` (number): The radius of the tire.
- `segments` (number): The number of segments.
- `spokeStiffness` (number): The stiffness of the spokes connecting to the center.
- `treadStiffness` (number): The stiffness of the outer tread.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react" label="<Tire />">

- `origin` (Vec2): The center of the tire.
- `radius` (number): The radius of the tire.
- `segments` (number): The number of segments.
