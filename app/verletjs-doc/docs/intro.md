# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Verlet.js, a simple and powerful 2D Verlet integration physics engine.

This ecosystem is composed of two main packages:

- **`verlet-engine`**: The core physics engine, written in TypeScript. It is completely headless and can be used in any JavaScript/TypeScript project.

- **`verlet-react`**: A React wrapper for `verlet-engine`, providing a set of components and hooks to easily integrate the physics simulation into a React application.

## What you will find in this documentation

This documentation is designed to help you understand how to use both `verlet-engine` and `verlet-react`.

- **Getting Started**: A quick guide to get you up and running with either the vanilla JS engine or the React components.

- **Core Concepts**: An explanation of the main principles behind the physics engine (particles, constraints, composites).

- **API Reference**: A detailed reference for both `verlet-engine` and `verlet-react`.

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides to create common simulations like cloth, ropes, and more.
